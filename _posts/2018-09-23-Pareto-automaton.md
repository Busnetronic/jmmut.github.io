# Pareto automaton

This is the first project in the series "one afternoon projects" I'm writing about. I've been doing
these for some years, but today I finally started writing about them. Maybe I will write about
previous ones, and hope I can write about future ones.

In this case the readme page is self explanatory so I will directly link to it:
