# Plotters
### Maturas and Attactor

These are two funny projects to plot point data.

Maturas is a height map generator and visualizer, and Attractor allows
visualizing 3D points while a function is applied to them, such as attractor
functions.

## Maturas

[Respository here](https://bitbucket.org/jmmut/maturas)

This is the simplest recursive algorithm I found to create terrains.

The algorithms takes a square and computes the middle points of it:

Then applies small changes, sampling a gaussian distribution, to those blue
points. After that, subdivides the square in four squares, and repeats
recursively.

The program has other simple functions to generate terrain, or load
arbitrary matrices from standard input. The color of the points is just the
height, set in the fragment shader.


## Attractor

I got interested in strange attractors such as the Lorenz or the Rossler one,
and experimented with point-based plotting.

Any function `f(R^3, dt) -> R^3` can be plotted. The set of points is initially
spread over a line or a square, and then the function is applied for every
point. Without parallelization, 250 thousand points can be handled at 60 FPS by
a i5 processor at 2.5 GHz.

The colors are computed in the shaders. Points close to the camera are blue, and
those far away are red.
